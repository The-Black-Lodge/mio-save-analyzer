So hostile. \nI still have some difficulty wrapping my mind around this... decay of their behaviour. Is their consciousness completely gone, or is it possible to restore it somehow? What is even causing all of this?\nI had hoped we could find these answers together, but I can't afford to wait for you. This place won't be safe much longer.\nI'm going to learn more about our inner workings. How we operate, and why.

Paranoia would be even worse than his current apathy.\nI should act before it comes to this. Liho suffered enough already, and this time I can actually do something to prevent it.

Since it requires an old-fashioned, consensual wired connection to transmit data from unit to unit, we're pretty safe from any unwanted spreading. Even contact should be safe, as long as you keep your ports closed.\n(And no, before you ask, I'm not reckless enough to try that.)\nUnfortunately, that's all I can learn from the farmlings. They're too simplistic in design to teach me anything relevant. It comes from their task I suppose — keeping the Travellers fed.
